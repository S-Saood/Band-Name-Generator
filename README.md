Random Name Generator


This project is a simple Random Name Generator built using JavaScript. It selects a random name from a predefined array of names using the built-in Math.random() function. You can easily customize the array to include any names you like. Running the script outputs a random name each time, making it useful for games, testing, or fun projects. The project is lightweight, beginner-friendly, and easy to understand.
